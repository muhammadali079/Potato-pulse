This code is a script for training convolutional neural network (CNN) models on a dataset using TensorFlow/Keras. Here's a brief overview of what 
the code does:

1. Dataset Loading:
   - Loads an image dataset from a directory, specifying image size, batch size, and shuffle preferences.
   - Extracts the class names found within the loaded dataset.
   - Partitions the dataset into training, validation, and test sets according to specified proportions.

2. Setup and Data Preprocessing:
   - Shuffles the dataset before partitioning.
   - The script begins by defining a list of learning rates to experiment with.
   - It defines data preprocessing steps such as resizing, rescaling, and data augmentation using TensorFlow Sequential API.
   - The dataset is partitioned into training (`train_ds`), validation (`val_ds`), and test (`test_ds`) sets. These datasets are cached, 
     shuffled, and prefetched for efficient processing.

3. Model Architecture:
   - The CNN model architecture is defined using TensorFlow Sequential API. It consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, 
     flattening, and dense layers.
   - The model is built with an input shape defined by batch size, image size, and number of channels.

4. Training Function:
   - A function `train_model_with_lr()` is defined to train the model with different learning rates.
   - Inside this function, the model is compiled with Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy metric.
   - The model is trained using the `fit()` function with training data (`train_ds`) and validated on validation data (`val_ds`) for a specified 
     number of epochs.

5. Training Loop:
   - The script iterates over each learning rate in the `learning_rates` list.
   - For each learning rate, a new model is trained using `train_model_with_lr()` function.
   - Training history (loss and accuracy) is saved to a text file, and the trained model is saved to disk using TensorFlow's SavedModel format 
     and Keras's .keras format.
   - Model performance metrics (loss and accuracy) for both training and validation sets are stored.

6. Results:
   - Model results (loss and accuracy) and model objects are displayed, collected and stored for further analysis or comparison.

7. Testing:
   - The predict() function takes a trained model and an image as input. It utilizes the model to predict the class probabilities for the 
     given image.
   - By selecting the class with the highest probability, it identifies the predicted class and calculates the confidence level for that 
     prediction.
   - The high accuracy achieved on the test dataset indicates that the model has successfully learned patterns and features from the training 
     data, enabling it to generalize well to unseen examples.
